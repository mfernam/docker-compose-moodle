assigned to questions.

Rate question usability improvements, specifically a mouse click on table cell selects the radio button as well.

Report now uses number of of participants instead of number of responses for averages on questions that have optional responses
(e.g. checkboxes).

Numeric question responses now allow comma decimal separator as well as period.

Data export now uses the more of the Moodle export API, and exports with 'CSV' extension rather than 'TXT'.

Incomplete responses can now be selected for export with the CSV export function.

In exported data, anonymous responses are assigned unique identifiers, so that responses from the same anonymous submitter can be
grouped.
